# Malware on Workstation
Workstation infection can be a combination of several things. This is why it is important to carry
out a comprehensive investigation of workstation infection before taking remediation action. Modern
attacks target users' workstations to a large extent, which is why they are also multi-stage, from initial
infection to establishing a foothold, to installing attacker tools, to performing remediation. Many of the
infection steps are automated by the attacker, so they often take place in a short period of time.

It is important to analyse and document the contamination of workstations:
* Date and time of first detection
* What has been observed on the workstation before?
   * Email
   * New files
   * Web browsing and downloads
   * Programmes executedd
* Is it ransomware?
   * If yes, are the user files encrypted?
     * If yes, which files and from which file path?
   * If yes, is there a blackmail message visible or has there been delivered one on other method (e.g. email)?
     * If yes, how did the blackmail message arrive? 
     * If yes, what are the requirements?
     * Document any findings
* Check the firewall logs for any alerts related to the workstation in SIEM/Log System
* Check if there are any indications of abnormal traffic in the Netflow data
 * What new connections have been opened since the detection of malware/anomaly?
* Check if there are any new/abnormal applications/services on the  workstation that start automatically
* Check for scheduled tasks (Scheduled task etc.)
* Are workstations finding new processes or applications?
   * If yes, can the process be identified as a process of a non-approved
application/binary?
     * If yes, what network connections does the process have?
     * If yes, what files does the process use?
     * If yes, under which permissions is the process run?
     * If yes, from which file path is the application/binary process started?
   * If not, do existing processes have open network connections to the Internet?
     * If yes, what are the identifiers of the connections (IP, TCP/UDP, port)?
   * If not, do existing processes have open network connections to services on the
internal network?
      * If yes, what are the normal user activities?
      * If yes, what seems abnormal?
* Check the register for any anomalies
   * Are any workstation maintenance tools (Powershell, etc.) used on the workstation?
     * If yes, are these approved maintenance measures?
     * If not, what tool has been used and what has been done with it?
* Check the logs in SIEM/Log System for any information found about network
connections, etc. found on workstations in other operating environments (i.e. other systems in organization environment)
