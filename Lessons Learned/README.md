# Post-analysis = Lessons Learned
It is important to conduct an after-action analysis and reporting of the cyber incident/incident. The after-action analysis will go through the steps of the incident in detail and try to identify how the incident was handled successfully, what could be improved in the future and what needs to be done to improve the environment so that something similar does not happen again or how to detect and handle it more effectively.

The lessons learned analysis is used to develop the organisation's capabilities and to address potential gaps and vulnerabilities. It can also be seen as a need for further training of staff. Corrections are made to guidelines and plans according to the shortcomings identified in the analysis. This is an important part of the organisation's recovery, learning and development process. Lessons learned should also be shared with the appropriate parties for dissemination and feedback. In the after-action analysis, it is important to identify which areas need to be improved or changed as a result of the incident, for example in security controls, practices, guidelines or policies.


# Recover Checklist
* Planned recovery process initiated, if necessary: 
     * Recover data from backup system to main system
     * Restoring data from backups
     * Patching/mitigation of vulnerabilities
     * Upgrading or reinstalling systems
     * Purchase or replacement of equipment
* Monitoring the progress of recovery measures
* Normal operations restored as quickly and cost-effectively as possible
     * Decision to return to normal operations made after recovery plan measures
     * Intensified environmental monitoring until it is confirmed that the anomaly is unlikely to recur
* The impact of the disruption on the organisation's operations, finances, and/or reputation is minimised

## Communication
* Stakeholders informed during the incident when needed
* Stakeholders are informed after the incident
* Organised a joint meeting to discuss the situation, its implications, and the shortcomings identified
* Press release where appropriate
* Lessons learned from the situation are shared with the with the authorities and appropriate parties

## Reporting and Lessons Learned analysis
* Evidence and risk indicators documented
* Reporting and post-event analysis of incident actions and decisions 
     * Description of how the incident was detected
     * Description of the information systems and data affected by the disruption
     * Knowing who is responsible for the system and data
     * What caused the disruption
     * Whether the identified incident was an identified risk in risk management and hypotheses
     * Description of how the incident was dealt with and how it was successfully dealt with
     * Whether the situation was handled according to instructions and practice
     * Whether the response to the incident report was sufficiently rapid
     * Was the effectiveness of the incident handling sufficient
     * Recommendations and measures to prevent similar disruptions in the future
     * What can be done better next time
     * What to practice
     * Where additional training or external help is needed
     * Identifying security remediation needs
     * Lessons learned from the walkthrough; how to improve incident handling for future situations
     * Timeline of events and actions from detection to closure of the incident
     * Evaluation of the effectiveness of communication (internal and external)
* Including in the post-analysis those involved in the management of the incident, the owners of the systems and data, management representatives and those who could have helped in the event of an incident
* Existing continuity and recovery plans and other guidelines reviewed, and corrected for identified deficiencies
* Updating policies and training staff where necessary
* Complaining if it is clear that the service provider has acted in breach of contract or practice
