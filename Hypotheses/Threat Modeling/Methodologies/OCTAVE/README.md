# OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation)

OCTAVE is methodology for identifying and managing information security risks. OCTAVE's first version 1.0 was released in 1999. Methodology has been developed since and its latest version OCTAVE Allegro 1.0 was released in 2007. Three major distinctive versions of OCTAVE are OCTAVE, OCTAVE-S and OCTAVE Allegro. These different versions of OCTAVE are implemented in different ways, so organization desiring to use this methodology should explore all of the versions to find one that suits the organisation's needs.

## OCTAVE

First version of OCTAVE was implemented for large organizations (+300 personnel). Small group consisting of organization IT department members and business unit members create an analysis team. This team plans and conducts different workshops for company employees. There are two types of workshops; Discussions with employees and activities conducted by analysis team. Data is gathered from each workshop and it is used to find out different threats in organization and mitigate these threats. 

OCTAVE is performed in three phases:

1. Identification of company assets, their security requirements, threats interfering with the requirements and protection strategies. This is mainly done by interviewing employees.
2. Identification of vulnerabilities based mostly on phase 1 threat analysis. 
3. Based on data gathered in phases 1 and 2, analysis team does risk analysis, develops risk mitigation plans and security strategy.

## OCTAVE-S

OCTAVE-S is similar to OCTAVE. Main difference is that OCTAVE-S is designed for smaller ogranizations. The three phases described in OCTAVE section are used by OCTAVE-S as well, but number and sequencing of activities differ from phases used in OCTAVE.
  
OCTAVE-S does not rely on initial information gathering workshops, since it expects that analysis team has wide knowledge of their organization. OCTAVE-S is also more friendly for less experienced security personnel because OCTAVE-S is more structured than OCTAVE. OCTAVE-S is designed to limit amount of infrastructure examination compared to OCTAVE, since smaller organizations may not have resources to invest on high-end vulnerability scanning tools.

## OCTAVE Allegro

Allegro is modernized version of OCTAVE. It puts more focus on simplicity of the threat modeling process by reducing resource, training and knowledge requirements. Allegro is also suitable for individuals doing risk assessment rather than just large organizations. It does not have to include workshops and questonnaires like original OCTAVE. 

Allegro contains 8 steps which can be categorized into 4 different areas of activity:

1. Drivers are established. Drivers are used to develop risk measurement criteria to evaluate organization's risks.
2. Profile information assets. Profiling is done by describing different information about the assets e.g. characteristics, usage and value. Phase also contains identification of information asset containers. Containers describe where assets are processed, transported and stored.
3. Identification of threats for information assets identified in 2nd phase. Assets threats are identified in context to their containers.
4. Identification and mitigation of risks. After identifying and analyzing risks, proper mitigation strategy is chosen depending on type of the risks.
