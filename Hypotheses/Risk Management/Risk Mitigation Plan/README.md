# Risk Mitigation Plan

When all the found risks are evaluated, risk mitigation plan is created to mitigate the risks in a predefined way. Cost-effectiveness of mitigation strategies should be taken into account when the plan is created. There may be several ways to deal with a certain risk, but some ways may be cheaper than others, which is why it is important to brainstorm different ways of mitigating the risk, if it isn't obvious how it should be dealt with. If the risk is too critical, it might be best to mitigate it even if the process is not cost-effective. Planning requires time and it is cheaper to plan the future procedure well, rather than do the execution poorly and fix potential mistakes created by the poor execution later on.

Mitigation tasks should be assigned to appropriate personnel that are capable of doing the task they are given. There are different strategies for mitigating the found risks. For example some risks can be accepted if their impact is low compared to mitigation cost. Risk avoidance may also be used if it is possible. If risks cannot be completely mitigated, their impact or possibility may still be reduced partially.

Risks classifications may change during mitigation process, which is why backup plan should be created as a part of the mitigation plan. Plan should at least include reevaluation of existing risks and discovering new risks during project.
