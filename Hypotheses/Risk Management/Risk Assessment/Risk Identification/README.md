# Risk Identification

Risk identification is the process of determining risks that could potentially prevent the program, enterprise, or investment from achieving its objectives. All the potential risk sources should be mapped, so all the areas of compromise will be considered. The process of finding risk sources and new risks continues throughout the risk management. New undiscovered areas of the program will be found when the scope is being digged deeper. All the potential risks are not most likely found during this phase and more risks will be added to known risks later on, which requires going back to previous phases, so the new risks will be added to old models, lists and graphs. Finding new risk may also reveal path to several other risks that have not been considered yet.

### Risk Identification Techniques  

There are many different [techniques](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264789624_Methods_of_risk_identification_in_companies%27_investment_projects) that can be used when doing risk identification. Different techniques have various benefits and disadvantages. E.g. SWOT analysis offers structured approach for identifying risks, but it tends to produce generic risks that are not project specific. Organization may use several techniques during their risk identification process or use the techniques as a guidance for creating their own techniques. Techniques used in risk identification should be considered based on their suitability for the organization's needs. Techniques can be different threat modeling [metholodogies](../../../Threat Modeling/Methodologies/) like [PASTA](../../../Threat modeling/Methodologies/PASTA/), which can be used to identify risks.

### Risk sources

Risks can be found from different environments. It is important for personnel doing risk assessment to recognize these environments. Risk sources can be at least found from physical, social, political, operational, economic, legal and cognitive environments. There can be risks in suprising places. E.g. government may implement new strict rules for certain industry affecting businesses on high scale in that area or earthquake could happen in some geographical area demolishing part or all of organization's infrastructure.
