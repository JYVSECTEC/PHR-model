# Reporting

During the reporting phase, organization informs personnel about what has been done during risk management process. One important thing that report should include is risk mitigation strategy for each risk and information about the implementation results. E.g. did the strategies used have desired results. Report is useful for internal organization personnel, but also for the team doing risk management. The old report can be utilized next time when doing risk management. It contains information about the old risks, how they were mitigated and was the mitigation successful etc. So, the report is also a documentation for next risk management processes to come.

### Report content

Reports are unique for each organization, since risk management processes vary. E.g. the report could include these sections:

<ol>
    <li><b>Risk decription</b>: Description of the risk, which can be general or more detailed information.</li>
    <li><b>Risk impact</b>: Potential impacts that risk may cause. This should contain sufficient information about the risk, so that internal audiences will get extensive understanding related to impact.</li>
    <li><b>previous plans and goals</b>: Information about potential previous mititigation that may have been used on the risk.</li>
    <li><b>Risk mitigation</b>: Mitigation methods that were used during this risk assessment process and personnel who are responsible for the mitigations to succeed.</li>
    <li><b>Mitigation effects</b>: Detailed effects of the mitigation strategy used.</li>
</ol>
