# Threat Modeling

**Introduction:**

Threat Modeling is process of finding and identifying assets in a predefined scope, searching vulnerabilites and threats from these assets, prioritizing found risks by level of their criticality and remediating these risks. There is no canonical way to do threat modeling, which lets individual groups and organizations design their own way of doing it. There are also many predefined methodologies that can be used partly or entirely as a basis for threat modeling process.

**Benefits:**

<ul>
    <li>Threat modeling helps to discover security issues in design-level. This potentially saves resources, since amount of threats can be mitigated already during product design phase. Fixing vulnerabilities from production system is much more expensive.</li>
    <li>Helps personnel understand what kind of threats exist and how they can preclude these threats with their own activity.</li>
    <li>Classifying threats by their impact to assets helps to create big picture of the worst case scenarios.</li>
    <li>Organizations can prepare for potential outbreaks before they happen by preemptively producing plans for these situations.</li>
</ul>
