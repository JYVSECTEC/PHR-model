# MITRE ATT&CK

MITRE ATT&CK is a knowledge base model for adversaries different attack techniques. Model was created in 2013 and has been developed since. ATT&CK model consists of different categories like privilege escalation, lateral movement and initial access. Under these categories are different category related techniques. Each technique section contains information of how it works and technique may also contain sub-techniques, which are shown to user. E.g. brute force technique under credential access contains 4 sub-techniques; password guessing, cracking, spraying and stuffing. Technique section also contains different APTs that have used the technique and ways to detect and mitigate the technique.  

Organizations may use the ATT&CK model to emulate adversary movement and different threats. Model is also good for assessing internal defensive tools and processes, so security program investments can be prioritized based on the assessment. Organizations may also use the model to test SOC's detection capability for different attacks. Red teams can use the model to plan new attack scenarios and design new attack vectors that may bypass defenses.

**Benefits**:

<ul>
    <li>ATT&CK model offers large database of attacking techniques, their mitigations, APTs etc.</li>
    <li>Model can be used by both blue and red teams for assessing their tools and techniques.</li>
    <li>Information about different APT techniques can be useful when defending against them or investigating their attacks.</li>
</ul>
