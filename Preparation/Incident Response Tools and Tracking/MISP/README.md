**Use case:**  From event to incident 


**Question:** How we can benefit for using MISP


**Answer:** When we inspect events/alerts from other tools, there might be something so suspicious that it needs more investigation. We can add it to MISP with Observables that it has (IP-addresses, hashes, etc..), and then we can manually or automatically continue investigation further. Enrich data. Form bigger picture that what is going on, and which events are related to others. Share this data to others.
