# Risk Monitoring

After the plan has been implemented, organization should monitor effectiveness of the implementation. They should check if risk response actions have been implemented as planned, responses are as effective as expected, proper policies and procedures are followed, risk trigger has occurred or new risks have occurred that were not previously identified. With help of monitoring, old strategies may be updated accordingly when monitoring discovers flaws in implemention process or aftermath of the process. So that this can happen, all positive and negative things should be noted and gathered up to understand what works and what does not work. Risk monitoring is important since it helps to demonstrate whether strategies are effective or not.

Risk monitoring can be categorized into four different categories as stated in [here](https://www.skillmaker.edu.au/risk-monitoring/):

<ul>
    <li><b>Voluntary</b>: Used to learn from events, which have occurred in the past. This is not mandatory or required by law.</li>
    <li><b>Obligatory</b>: Risk monitoring strategies, which are required by the law to ensure that proper risk monitoring and management methods are in use.</li>
    <li><b>Reassessment</b>: Secondary or tertiary assessment of risk and risk management strategies.</li>
    <li><b>Continual</b>: Always ongoing monitoring.</li>
</ul>

### Levels of monitoring

Some risks may require more monitoring than others and some risks do not need to be monitored at all. Low impact risks with low likelihood to happen are the risks that require the least monitoring. Whereas high impact risks with high likelihood require more monitoring than other risks. Leaving those risks without monitoring exposes a risk in itself. Monitoring is a continuously changing process. Some risks may require more monitoring at certain point, but as the monitoring goes on, you may learn that particular risk needs less monitoring or even more.

### Sources for risk monitoring information

Risk monitoring is itself a research-oriented task to see how a risk or risk source is changing. Resources for risk monitoring can be categorized into internal and external sources. Internal sources include people working in the organization with information about the risk and internal audit reports. External sources can include data mining and industry specific magazines/publications. These were just examples. There are many other sources that can be found helpful.
