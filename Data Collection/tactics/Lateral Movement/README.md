# Lateral Movement

## Description

An initial system that the adversary gains access to in the target environment is often not the ultimate system they are targeting. Reaching the ultimate target requires moving through multiple systems, a process that is called lateral movement. Lateral movement tactic category consists of techniques that enable the adversary to access and control remote systems over the network. Adversaries can take advantage of native remote access tools or install third party tools to accomplish lateral movement.
