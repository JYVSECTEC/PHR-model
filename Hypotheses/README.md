# Hypotheses

Hypotheses contains two different sections called threat modeling and risk management. Threat modeling is used as a part of risk management to find threats. Under threat modeling, there is information about different threat modeling [methodologies](Threat Modeling/Methodologies/). 

Risk management contains different phases of risk management process. As a difference compared to several other risk management processes, this documentation contains [hypotheses](Risk Management/Risk Assessment/Hypotheses/) and [risk to threat](Risk Management/Risk Assessment/Risk to Threat/) sections under risk assessment. These two sections are important in this risk management documentation.
