# Risk Management

Risk management is process of identifying risks from organization, evaluating those risks, prioritizing risks by level of their potential threat, creating risk management plan, sorting out threat actors that could abuse these risks turning them into real threats, implementing the plan and continuing surveillance of these risks. There are many different views for the steps taken or processes performed in risk management. Some models may consist of less steps and other models contain many operations in a single phase. 

In this documentation the risk management phases are these:


1. [Risk assessment](https://github.com/JYVSECTEC/PHR-model/tree/master/Hypotheses/Risk%20Management/Risk%20Assessment/README.md)  
  1.1 [Risk Identification](https://github.com/JYVSECTEC/PHR-model/tree/master/Hypotheses/Risk%20Management/Risk%20Assessment/Risk%20Identification/README.md)  
  1.2 [Risk Analysis](https://github.com/JYVSECTEC/PHR-model/tree/master/Hypotheses/Risk%20Management/Risk%20Assessment/Risk%20Analysis/README.md)  
  1.3 [Risk Evaluation](https://github.com/JYVSECTEC/PHR-model/tree/master/Hypotheses/Risk%20Management/Risk%20Assessment/Risk%20Evaluation/README.md)  
  1.4 [Hypotheses](https://github.com/JYVSECTEC/PHR-model/tree/master/Hypotheses/Risk%20Management/Risk%20Assessment/Hypotheses/README.md)  
  1.5 [Risk to Threat](https://github.com/JYVSECTEC/PHR-model/tree/master/Hypotheses/Risk%20Management/Risk%20Assessment/Risk%20to%20Threat/README.md)  
2. [Risk Mitigationt Plan](https://github.com/JYVSECTEC/PHR-model/tree/master/Hypotheses/Risk%20Management/Risk%20Mitigation%20Plan/README.md)
3. [Plan Implementation](https://github.com/JYVSECTEC/PHR-model/tree/master/Hypotheses/Risk%20Management/Plan%20Implementation/README.md)
4. [Risk Monitoring](https://github.com/JYVSECTEC/PHR-model/tree/master/Hypotheses/Risk%20Management/Risk%20Monitoring/README.md)
5. [Reporting](https://github.com/JYVSECTEC/PHR-model/tree/master/Hypotheses/Risk%20Management/Reporting/README.md)


Steps are divided into their own sections where actions performed in the step are explained. Purpose of these steps and why risk management is done, is to pre-emptively prepare for potential threats that the risks comprise. Damage caused by the threats can be mitigated before the damage happens. Risks that are unknown may cause shockingly more serious consequences than the risks which are prepared for. 

Risk management process shouldn't be a one time thing. It should be continuous process done between certain time frames or milestones like notable infrastructure changes in organization. This way the new risks can be discovered as soon as possibilities for their exploitation appear. After risk management is done for the first time, future processes will go much smoother since mistakes done previously can be recognized and avoided. It is also important to notify good things done in previous processes and make sure they are utilized in future processes.
