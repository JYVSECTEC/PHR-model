# Risk Evaluation

When the risks are analysed, their significance to the organization should be evaluated. Based on the evaluation, each risk should be accepted or treated some way. Impact caused by some lesser risks may be so insignificant that they can be accepted without any need for preparation. There is no specific criteria for what kind of risks should be accepted and each team doing risk evaluation should assess these risks considering their own environment, which the risks could potentially affect. 

### Risk Criteria

Risk criteria should be used as aid when doing the evaluation. Criteria could include risk's associated costs, stakeholder opinion, enviromental factors regarding the risk etc. Impact and likelihood of the risks were defined in the previous analysis phase and its results should be used as basis for the criteria. In some cases fixing risk may cost more than impact caused by the risk. In these situations it is important to notify likelihood of the risk and how many times the impact caused by the risk may occur. If the threat caused by the risk is likely to happen and the impact isn't one time thing, it might be better to fix the risk rather than accept it. Other way around the impact caused by the risk could only occur once and fixing it would be more expensive than the financial cost caused by the impact. In this situation it does not matter how likely the risk is to happen, since it is cheaper to take the impact rather than fix the risk being abused. Though it should be notified that risks may lead to other risks and abusing them all could cause a chain reaction leading to much higher expenses than originally expected. This is related to risk refining and hypotheses, which are explained in [risk to threat](../Risk%20to%20Threat/) and [hypotheses](../Hypotheses/) sections.

### Risk prioritization

Risk evaluation is balancing between acceptance and handling of the risks. Many factors need to be taken into account when the evaluation is under process. Risks should be prioritized based on demand to fix them. Some risks may be so critical that they require quick and immediate fix. These are the risks that should be of the highest priority. Lower priority risks should be mitigated after the higher priority risks have been fixed, which is point of the risk priorization.
