# Hypotheses

Hypotheses contains two different sections called threat modeling and risk management. Threat modeling is used as a part of risk management to find threats. Under threat modeling, there is information about different threat modeling [methodologies](https://github.com/JYVSECTEC/PHR-model/tree/master/Hypotheses/Threat%20Modeling/Methodologies/README.md). 

Risk management contains different phases of risk management process. As a difference compared to several other risk management processes, this documentation contains [hypotheses](https://github.com/JYVSECTEC/PHR-model/tree/master/Hypotheses/Risk%20Management/Risk%20Assessment/Hypotheses/README.md) and [risk to threat](https://github.com/JYVSECTEC/PHR-model/tree/master/Hypotheses/Risk%20Management/Risk%20Assessment/Risk%20to%20Threat/README.md) sections under risk assessment. These two sections are important in this risk management documentation.
