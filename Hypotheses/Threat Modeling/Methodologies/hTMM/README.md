# hTMM (Hybrid Threat Modeling Method)

hTMM was developed by Carnegie Mellon University (Software Engineering Institute) research team in 2018. The method research can be read [here](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=516617). The method is a combination of SQUARE, Security Cards and PnG (Personae non gratae). hTMM was created considering weaknesses of other threat modeling methods and desirable characteristics which a threat modeling methodology would have. E.g. these desirable characteristics contain cost-effectiveness and no overlooking of threats. Additional characteristics like intuitiviness and tool support were also considered.

hTMM contains 5 different steps, which are shortly described here:

1. Identification of threat modeled system.
2. Use [security cards](../Security Cards) for brainstorming session and gather all data generated by the session.
3. Prune out unlikely PnGs and non-realistic attack vectors to gather up realistic misuse cases.
4. Summarization of first three steps utilizing tool support.
5. Potentially continue with formal risk assessment method by using results gained with hTMM.
