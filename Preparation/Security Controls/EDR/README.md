**Introduction:** Endpoint Detection and Response;  Antivirus can detect malicious files, but EDR focuses more for suspicious activity

**Benefits:**
- It is important to get visibility for what is going to endpoint devices and EDR helps on that. Getting knowledge about running processes, user logins and file modification helps to detect malisious activity
- Can be used to detect know bad actions, but also for finding suspicious activity on end devices. 
 

**Worth noticing:** 
- It is possible to protect/ get visibility for ceratin parts TTPs that attackers might use. But it is important to keep in your mind that this gives only visibility to anomalous behaviour on endpoints. 
- Attackers can do anomalous activity on other places for example getting credentials might be done via social media, fake sites etc, e-mails... that isn't visible for EDR... 
- To get most use of for EDR data, combine it with other controls; What is going on network, what actors are targetting us etc...
- Doesn't eliminate need for antivirus software; AV focuses on malicious files, EDR gives visibility on bigger picture. And  also helps to analyzing attack phases
- Sometimes it is hard to find what are things that should be causing alerts, so that there won't be too many false positives.  



**Features:**
- File integrity checks
- continuous monitoring and response to advanced threats
- Suspicious activity detection
- Data exploration
