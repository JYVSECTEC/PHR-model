**Introduction:** " The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more."


**Features:**

- Data Analytics
- Visualization
- Machine Learning


**Worth noticing:**

- Can be used many ways
- Can be used to test what do we have detection rules for certain events
- Can be usedto querry mail for certain malicious events etc..


**Also fits in:** Threat hunting, Triage

**How this tool integrates to our PHR model:** 
Jupyter Notebooks can be used on so many places: We can make queries from our SIEM& IDS system, draw analytics from data that we have. Can even help us to analyze that if our baseline for rules is too strict or loose by comparing our realtime data vs baseline data. Really good tool for threat hunting for investigation anomalies/suspicious behaviour.
