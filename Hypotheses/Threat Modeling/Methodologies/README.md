# Methodologies

**Introduction:**

Methodologies offer different models for threat modeling. Some models are designed for specific cases. E.g. [CVSS](https://github.com/JYVSECTEC/PHR-model/tree/master/Hypotheses/Threat%20Modeling/Methodologies/CVSS/README.md) is scoring system that can be used to determine potential risk of a vulnerability by observing its CVSS score. This is as a great model for classifying vulnerabilities, but it is more of an [alternative](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/AdvancedThreatModeling.pdf) way to do threat modeling, since it is scoring system rather than actual framework. Alternative threat models are great addition for ordinary threat models and generally different methodologies can be used together if they match with assets within scope.
