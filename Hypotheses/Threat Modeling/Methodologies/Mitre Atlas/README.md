# MITRE ATLAS
MITRE ATLAS, Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems, is a knowledge base of adversary tactics, techniques, and case studies for machine learning (ML) systems based on real-world observations, demonstrations from ML red teams and security groups, and the state of the possible from academic research.

Benefits:

    ATLAS model offers database of attacking techniques against AI and Machine Learning systems.
    Model can be used by both blue and red teams for assessing their tools and techniques.
    Information about different APT techniques can be useful when defending against them or investigating their attacks.
