# Data Breach investigation
Data breach in this case refers to an attack on a system or service where a user/attacker has gained
access to unauthorised information and activities. A data breach may be committed using existing
access rights or by exploiting a vulnerability. 

It is important to analyse and document the data breach:
1. Time of observation
2. Targeting system
3. Is this an unauthorised use of access rights?
     * If yes, what level of access rights are involved?
     * If yes, are any of user IDs with IT management privileges?
4. Is this an exploitation of vulnerability?
     * If yes, what was the method used to break into the system?
     * If yes, is the vulnerability publicly known?
         * If not, prepare a dossier on the vulnerability and contact your local authority (e.g. National CERT) to
coordinate the vulnerability.
         * If yes, is there a more detailed description of the exploitation method for
the vulnerability?  
         * If yes, is there a mitigation method for the vulnerability?
5. Are there similar anomalies observed in other systems?
6. What information has the attacker/user had access to through the system?
     * Is the data classified?
         * If yes, is this confidential information of the organisation?
         * If yes, is this confidential information of the organisation's customers?
     * Is there any personal data in the system?
         * If yes, please contact the Data Protection Officer
         * If yes, has access been gained to the information?
         * If yes, find out whose data has been seen/available to the attacker/user
7. From which source IP was the data breach committed?
8. What method has the attacker/user used?
9. Was the attacker/user able to execute malicious code on the system?
     * If yes, which process or application was added by the attacker/user?
     * If yes, where is the malicious code located on the system?
     * If yes, does the malicious code open a command channel for the attacker to enter
the system?
         * If yes, what is the communication channel between the system and the
attacker's server?
         * If yes, what is the destination IP address of the command line?
         * If yes, find out whether a similar command channel is used elsewhere in
the environment
