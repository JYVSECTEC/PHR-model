# Incident Response
Preparedness against cyber threats may not be sufficient to prevent all possible incidents if attacker has capabilities and motivation. The response to a cyber incident will then become significant. Response, like preparedness, needs to be planned, prepared and practiced before situation arises. Cyber incident management and incident response are defined processes for investigating, analysing, resolving and recovering from incidents. A cyber incident is a cyber threat that has been successful and that causes disruption to business operations or the functioning of systems.

A key role in cyber security incidents is cyber triage, which determines what the alert/detection/suspicion is really about. In the triage phase, it is important to find out what has happened, when it happened and what the impact is on the business. Not every alert/detection necessarily means an incident, but it is important to handle them according to the triage process so that a real cyber attack is not mistakenly ignored. The length of time it takes to deal with a cyber incident depends a lot on the severity and complexity of the incident. While the simplest incidents can be handled quickly in a matter of minutes, more complex incidents can take weeks to investigate, handle and recover from.

When dealing with a cyber incident and outage, it is important to consider the overall situation management and ensure a comprehensive investigation and collection of lessons learned and areas for improvement. This will also enable the organisation to continuously improve its ability to prevent and investigate future attacks.

The purpose of the incident response (IR) process is to describe at a more detailed level how the handling of detections and incidents is done at an operational level. The operational level refers here to those involved in the practical work of the IR process (e.g. technical experts, system
administrators, security manager, data protection officer, communication). These people should be identified in advance and, if necessary, additional people can be brought into the IR process to deal with a cyber incident as and when required. The IR process should include a description of the full lifecycle approach to the incident.

Example frameworks for IR processes have been published by ISO (27035:2016), SANS and NIST. The organisation should apply the guidelines to enable its own activities. The IR process is based on systematic work at different stages of the incident/incident handling process. The objective of the IR process is an efficient and clear operational handling of incidents/events and a model of continuous improvement through lessons learned and experience gained from incidents.

## Cyber Crime investigation
Cyber Crime investigation in organizations is a joint task for organization itself and police authorities. Depending on national procesesses how Police Authorities can be involved in cyber crime investigation, organization should have clear process how to inform Police on the attack, and how to collaborate on the investigation. JYVSECTEC and Finland's Police University College created a guide to help organizations to understand the activities that happen during the cyber crime investigation. The comprehensive guide ["Kyberrikos on poliisiasia"](https://www.jamk.fi/globalassets/tutkimus-ja-kehitys--research-and-development/tki-projektien-lohkot-ja-tiedostot/cyberdi/tietopankki/oppaat/kyberrikos-on-poliisiasia.pdf) is only in Finnish, the English version ["Cybercrime is a police matter : an introduction to a Finnish guidebook for enterprises on cybercrime investigation process"](https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fe2021111755746) is an introduction of Finland's national guide.

In the guide there is an excellent list of information the Police authority might be interested in:
> The police are often asked for universal advice on how enterprises as victims can obtain evidence from information and communication systems by themselves. However, the relevant evidence, techniques and tactics depend on the case. The police collect evidence – or instruct the victim to do so – and advice on other necessary measures depending on the case. Early contact with the police ensures that the evidence is not destroyed or transformed inadmissible.
> 1. Is it known whether the injured party has the situation under control or does the attacker still have access to the computer systems? How is this known?
>     * Does the injured party have a plan of action? What kind?
> 2. What kind of damage has the injured party suffered and, according to estimates, how widely?
>     * Can the problem escalate beyond the company?
> 3. What kind of structure, connections and interdependencies do the information systems have?
>     * Who owns the information systems? Is it the company itself or service providers and, if service providers, which ones?
>     * How are the roles and responsibilities defined? Who are the owners of each type of data and what has been agreed on handling the data?
>     * If the information systems have dependencies beyond the company, for example, with other company’s systems, are the log files on data traffic available?
>     * What kind of information security solutions protect the information systems and data? Have there been any alerts, which could be related to the incident?
>     * In addition, maintenance of information systems, version control, update cycles and differences between timestamps are important knowledge.
> 4. Has anyone gathered or analysed the evidence? Who has documented the measures and how?
>     * Have events and measures been put in a timeline, for example?
>     * Has any other body such as Traficom’s Cybersecurity Centre or a private computer security specialist conducted some analyses?
> 5. What kind of logging policy has been in the company’s information systems and their different parts?
>     * Are there some traces available other than those already gathered?
>     * Are there some relevant devices left on but in offline mode, waiting for evidence collection?
>     * Have some relevant devices been shut down or reinstalled that may have caused a loss of evidence?
>     * Is it necessary or possible to temporarily increase the level of logging?
> 6. What kind of backups are available?
>     * Do they cover functions and systems relevant to the case? Do the timespans reach far enough?
> 7. Are there other devices, which may hold some evidence?
>     * During a criminal investigation, the police may request infected device for investigation or capture computer forensic images on site. The aim is to cause as little disruption as possible to business.
> 8. Is it possible to rule out an insider suspect?
>     * Do some people have access to computer systems in such ways that it may affect the evidence?
>     * Who holds administrative privileges?
>     * Who has access to the information system and security architecture descriptions and documentation?
>     * Has somebody’s user credentials been used for abnormal log-ins?
>     * Do partners have access to company’s information systems? Which ones?
>     * Have former employees’ user credentials been de-activated?
> 9. Is there any knowledge of what kind of confidential data has been potentially endangered?
>     * Who could benefit from the confidential data?
> 10. What is the nature of the attack?
>     * Are there signs of a targeted attack?
>     * Can the real target or motive be something other than what it appears to be at first?
> 11. Has the company previously been a victim of cybercrime?
>     * Did it then report to the police or other authorities?
> 12. Have the staff or CCTV monitoring noticed anything abnormal?
>     * Do outsiders have access to the company premises? Have there been observations of abnormal events?
>     * Have there been abnormal comments in social media or phishing campaigns?
>     * Have the staff participated in external events where their device could have been infected?
> 13. Is there a need for external communication?
>     * External communication should be discussed with the police beforehand, because it may affect the on-going criminal investigation.
