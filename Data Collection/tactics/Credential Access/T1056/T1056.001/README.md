# T1056.001 - Keylogging

## Description

Keylogging is the most widely used input capture method, where the adversary installs a software that records userâ€™s keystrokes and sends them back to the adversary. Other common methods include presenting fake credential prompts to user, injecting code to login pages or wrapping the Windows default credential provider.

## Event Mapping

* Event ID 12: RegistryEvent (Object create and delete)

Windows stores credential provider definitions in registry location:

* HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Authentication\CredentialProviders

Creation of new credential provider can be detected by monitoring Sysmon registry modification events for the CredentialProviders location.
