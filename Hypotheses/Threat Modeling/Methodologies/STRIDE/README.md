# STRIDE

STRIDE is acronym for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service and Elevation of Privilege. STRIDE is used to model in-place system and identify associated threats by building data flow diagrams (DFDs). DFD describes different system assets and what kind of interaction they have with each other by graphical data flows and trust boundaries between the assets. After the DFDs are done, different threats can be documented by doing brainstorming based on the events and boundaries between the DFD assets. STRIDE model is more focused on software development and e.g. it can be used to show data flows between processes, APIs, databases etc. which helps software developers model potential threats like bugs for different software components. STRIDE model was originally invented by Loren Kohnfelder and Praerit Garg in 1999 and the model has been evolving since.
