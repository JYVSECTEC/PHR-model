# Improvements
Improvements means continues development of security posture and capabilities to detect and analyze cyber attacks. The improvements can be identified during the post-analysis (lessons learned) phase or based on by threat intelligence of current vulnerabilities, attacks or technologies. Improvements depend on the target environment and should always be assessed on the value that it brings and costs. 

The value of improvement needs to be evaluated against hypotheses of expected attack and how the improvement can help to protect the business services or other critical functionalities of organization
