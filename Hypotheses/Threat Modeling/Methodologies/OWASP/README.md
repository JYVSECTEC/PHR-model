# OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)

OWASP is a software security based non-profit foundation that was started by Mark Curphey in 2001. OWASP offers lots of different community created tools, documents, guides etc. Organizations can use these assets in their own threat modeling process to create software, patch software and maintain the software. 

### OWASP top 10

One very known OWASP project is called OWASP top 10, which contains top 10 web application security vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are documented and each of them has own section in the document. Sections contain vulnerability related attack vectors, security weaknesses allowing these attacks to happen, impacts of potential attacks, attack scenario examples, references and preventation strategies. Top 10 documents have been published since 2003 and the latest version was released in 2017.

### Web Application Testing Guide

OWASP has also released web application testing guides since 2004. Newest version (22.04.2021) [4.1](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/) was released in 2020. Testing guide contains different wep application based vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are explained and different ways to abuse those vulnerabilities are also documented by showing different payloads and techniques to achieve exploitation.

### Threat Dragon

Threat Dragon is an open-source threat modeling tool created by OWASP. It can be used to create threat modeling diagrams (DFDs). It is available as web application and standalone desktop app.


**Benefits**:

<ul>
    <li>OWASP offers many different tools to use when threat modeling web applications.</li>
    <li>OWASP is open source project, so all the materials are available for free.</li>
    <li>OWASP Top 10 helps organizations prioritize web application vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li>Web Application Testing Guide helps companies to identify potential attack vectors during threat modeling process.</li>
    <li>Threat Dragon helps to visualize potential attack vectors.</li>
</ul>
