# Plan Implementation

Implementation is part where the risk mitigation plan is carried out. Different stakeholders responsible for mitigating certain risks are informed about the risk(s) and they are instructed how to deal with these risks. Risk management team may understand these risks well, but personnel in the team may not be the best for mitigating certain risks, if they have no knowledge about the area of the risk. Depending on the risk, the mitigation may be done more efficiently if person or team with experience on the area, are the ones doing the mitigation related tasks. Cost-effectiveness for example could be a thing that influences the decision of whom should do the mitigation. This of course depends on risk management team and stakeholders opinions on what is the best option.  

Staff responsible for mitigating risks, should keep risk management team informed about the mitigation process and potential issues they have noticed during the mitigation, which for example could make the mitigation plan difficult to accomplish. If the staff have their own opinions on how to do the mitigation process or parts of it, they should inform risk management team with these proposals. If anything is done in a different way than originally planned, risk management team should be informed. Performing actions without discussing about them with risk management team, may create new risks if the mitigation is not done accordingly. Supervising mitigation staff is documented in the next step, which is [monitoring](../Risk Monitoring/).

As stated in [evaluation](../Risk Assessment/Risk Evaluation/) section, risks can be dealt with different ways depending on the risk. For example mitigation process of some risks may be transferred to 3rd party if the mitigation is an insurance for some technical system. There are also positive risks. E.g. company may be too overpowered on certain business area, so the company may be considered as a monopoly by regulators.
