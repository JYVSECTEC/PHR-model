# PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)

PASTA is a seven step framework for assessing organization's risks like potential business impacts caused by attacks. PASTA was developed by Tony UcedaVÃ©lez in 2012. PASTA can be used as risk or asset based model that also has attacker-centric elements. PASTA has capability to assess entire cybersecurity posture of an organization by going through all seven stages of the framework. PASTA's goal is to provide framework that can be used to model sophisticated and unpredictable threats.

Seven stages of PASTA:

1. Define business and security objectives.
2. Define technical scope.
3. Decompose and analyse application.
4. Execution of threat analysis.
5. Analysis of weaknesses and vulnerabilities found in 4th stage.
6. Enumeration and modeling of attacks and exploits.
7. Risk analysis, identification of countermeasures and risk migitations measures.
