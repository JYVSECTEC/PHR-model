# Privilege Escalation

## Description

Privilege escalation tactic consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. Adversaries often gain initial access to systems through normal unprivileged user accounts. However, many of the techniques later in the kill chain require privileged account to be executed, thus the adversary needs a way to escalate their privileges. Common ways to accomplish privilege escalation is to take advantage of system weaknesses, misconfiguration or vulnerabilities.
