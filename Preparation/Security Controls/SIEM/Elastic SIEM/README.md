Events, alerts and data we gather with other tools are send to elastic SIEM, where we can analyze situation


**Use case:** Monitoring logins

**Use case:** Using SIEM for investigation


**Basis:** In our environment we monitor all device logins & admin actions


**Question:** How will SIEM helps us finding breach & investigating


**Answer:** Our SIEM did alett us from suspicious activity, We did find that soon after knocking our honeypot, on other device new account was created. With SIEMs time-line featurewe we're able to find what attacker tried to do with that account. Also our firewall was logging all activity, which we did decrypt with proxy, so we we're able to see on which url/ ip-addresses attacker was accessing. By gathering these evidence IoCs to our MISP, our analyst can form Threat Intelligence
