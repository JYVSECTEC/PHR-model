## Risks into hypotheses

Hypotheses can be created based on the known risks. These hypotheses expand understanding of impact area caused by the potential risk. With a single hypothese, future impact chain caused by risk can be envisioned before it has even happened. These impact chains may also vary depending on the type of the risk. If the risk impact is caused by some malicious attacker, the attacker's motivations and goals may define what kind of impact the risk will have. This will be discussed more in the [risk to threat](../Risk%20to%20Threat/) section. You can think about different threat scenarios and consider all the risks that may be part of this scenario, since combined together, risks create chains and some risks may cause same the impact, meaning there are variety of attack chains for same impact at the end of the chain. For example [attack tree](../../../Threat%20Modeling/Methodologies/Attack%20Tree/) is a threat modeling methodology that can be used to create these chains. This directory contains few examples of different hypotheses.

Hypotheses may help to find new undiscovered risks. Whenever a new risk is found, it should be [analysed](../Risk%20Analysis/) and [evaluated](../Risk%20Evaluation/) like all the previously found risks. This creates a cycle inside risk assessment, where risk management team moves backwards after finding new risks.
