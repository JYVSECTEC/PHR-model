# Command and Control

## Description

Command and control (C&C) is a tactic category where the adversary remotely controls systems they have compromised in the target environment. The servers used to control compromised machines usually reside outside of the victim network, on the Internet.

Adversaries use various methods to hide their communication. Common network protocols, such as HTTP and DNS are often used for communication to mimic normal network traffic occurring in the environment. Data obfuscation and encryption techniques also make it harder to detect and analyze command and control traffic
