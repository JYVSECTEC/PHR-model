# Eradication
Eradication is important phase to ensure the attacker foothold and access has been removed from environment. Eradication procedures depend on the nature of attack but it can include removal of attacker tools/software (e.g. malware), reconstruction of systems or reinstallation from backups.

# Recovery
The recovery phase can be moved on to when it is found that the remedies have worked. Recovery phase measures may include restoring data from backups, patching, updating and reinstalling vulnerabilities, and replacing equipment. During the recovery phase, operations are restored to normal.

The end of the disruption should be communicated to the target groups, with communications tailored to the needs of each group. The communication can include, for example, a description of what happened, the general reason for the incident and the outcome of the incident. At this stage, information is also provided on any recommendations for action and instructions on how to return to normal operations. After the incident and its effects, it is also useful to organise a joint meeting to discuss the shortcomings and successes identified.

## Documentation
It is important to accurately document the steps involved in mitigation and recovery, as well as any associated evidence and indicators of compromise. This will help to understand what happened and prevent similar situations from occurring in the future. It can often be challenging to document in real time alongside other recovery activities, but it is important to take sufficient notes to prepare for future incidents and prevent potential threats from occurring. The shorter the period of time after recovery, the more likely it is that an accurate picture of what happened will be recorded.

Improvements in recovery capacity should also be documented by analysing the current situation and the recovery phases of previous disorders, and identifying key factors such as problems that caused significant delays or small but recurring problems.

## Recovery plan
Systems and processes should have their own recovery plans, which are regularly updated and easily accessible. Recovery plans describe, among other things, the measures, roles and responsibilities for returning to normal and how to communicate in the event of a disruption. Continuity planning must take into account the recovery of individual systems and processes as well as recovery at organisational level. In the event of a large-scale failure, the criticality of systems and the priority of their recovery must be defined. It is important to consider the interactions between systems and any subsystems.

Service providers and subcontractors must also be required to have recovery plans for their services. Recovery plans must be continuously developed according to identified deficiencies, including the definition of timelines and responsible persons for the implementation of repairs. Deficiencies in outsourced services should be addressed and corrected with service providers. Complaints may also be an option if it is clearly seen that the service provider has acted in breach of contract or practice.
