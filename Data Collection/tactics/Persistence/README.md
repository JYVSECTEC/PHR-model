# Persistence

## Description

Persistence is a tactic where the adversary aims to maintain their foothold on systems where they have gained access. An adversary might lose access to the systems due to operating system restarts, credential changes, connection blocking or removal of files or tools. The techniques in this category include any access, action, or configuration changes that let the adversary maintain their foothold on systems, such as replacing or hijacking legitimate code or adding startup code.
