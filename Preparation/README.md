Preparations include essential processes, technologies, and procedures to manage the environment and prepare for handling the attacks.

The essential tools depend on the needs of the organization and the complexity of their technical environment. Tools should be chosen based on the type of attacks they work against. The most likely attacks should be determined on [hypotheses](../Hypotheses).
