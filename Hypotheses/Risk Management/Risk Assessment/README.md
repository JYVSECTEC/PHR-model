# Risk Assessment

Risk management starts with risk assessment that consists of five consecutive phases. These phases cover identification of risks, analysis of the risks found, evaluation of their criticality, hypotheses based on the risks and risk to threat where risks are refined to threats. After the risk assessment is done, potential risks should be identified, analysed and categorized, so next [step](../Risk Mitigation Plan/) of the process can be conducted. Risk assessment steps can be different depending on documentation. Usually risk assessment consists of the first three steps (Identification, analysis and evaluation). In this documentation, hypotheses and risk to threat were added as their own steps for risk assessment process.

Risk assessment should be planned carefully before its execution. Preparation includes identification of the assessment's purpose, determination of the risk assessment scope, identification of risk model and analytic approaches used during the assessment etc.
